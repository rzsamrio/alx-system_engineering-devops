BASIC DEFINITIONS

A server is a physical or virtual computer whose primary task is to facilitate the sharing of resources
on a network. It is a computer and thus possess an Operating system that allows it to perform these
operations.

The domain name serves as human readable means of representing the address of an server on a network.

'www' is a subdomain of the domain 'foobar.com'. It is recorded on the CNAME of the DNS Server and
can be used to alias the domain 'foobar.com'.

A webserver is a server that deals with the sending, recieving and interpreting of http requests to respond to
client requests.

An application server is a system which works with a database to generate dynamic responses to client requests.

A database serves as a storage, managing, allocation of important and necessary in a network.

The server uses a TCP/IP for communication, that is Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to communicate 
with the user (client)



INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS
SPOF: In the web design on the diagram, The SPOF is any point of the infrastructure e.g the server, database, 
ips/router, this is due to the lack of redundancies.

Downtime when maintenance needed: Since the network operates oon a signle server, during maintenance
there is need for a shut down inorder to update or fix the system. Thus, causing downtime.

Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic: Servers have a limit on the amount of traffic they can allow simultaneously and an overload will cause the server to crash. This is very likely in the single server infrastructure designed above.
