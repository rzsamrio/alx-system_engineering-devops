As a broader subject, configuration management (CM) refers to the process of systematically handling changes to a system in a way that it maintains integrity over time.
Automation plays an essential role in server configuration management. It’s the mechanism used to make the server reach a desirable state, previously defined by provisioning scripts using a tool’s specific language and features.
Automation is in fact, the heart of configuration management for servers, and that’s why it’s common to also refer to configuration management tools as Automation Tools or IT Automation Tools.
Three of the most popular configuration management tools available in the market today: Ansible, Puppet, and Chef.
